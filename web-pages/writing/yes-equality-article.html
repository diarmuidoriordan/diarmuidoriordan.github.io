            <h3>Originally published in the<br />October 2015 U.K. edition of<br /><i>Mensa Magazine</i></h3>

		<div id="article-container">
			<p>On Friday 22nd May 2015, I cast my first vote. In the 8 years since gaining suffrage when I turned 18, this was the first time I was sufficiently moved to utilise it. My contribution was small, the result was historic. You probably read about it.</p>

			<p>The backstory: I have lived all my life in South East Ireland, in the picturesque medieval city of Kilkenny. I knew I was different from a young age, but it wasn't until I was 15 that I realised I was gay. I knew I wasn't attracted to girls, but it took me a while to realise that the feelings I had towards some of the boys in my class was the feeling that they felt when they looked at some of the girls. I had no frame of reference. I had nothing to compare it to. At no point during my life did anyone explain sexual attraction in a relatable way. In a way it was always implied that one would know it when one experienced it.</p>

			<p>However "gay" was always the bad thing. It was an insult. You were "gay" if you studied too hard and did well in class. You were "gay" if you weren't good at sports. Any deviation from the norm was "gay". (I should clarify that I am just about old enough to be talking about a time just before the word "gay" came to mean anything that wasn't working properly, or was just annoying - when I was called "gay" by my classmates it was meant in the most patriarchally derogatory way; "you are a lesser man than I"). I felt confused. I felt alone.</p>

			<p>But I wasn't alone. In Alan I found a caring friend, mentor and confidante. He was my first gay friend and I will never forget the day I came out to him. I was 17 years old. In the car one day I just told him, just blurted it, just threw it right out there. And the world didn't stop turning. The sun didn't stop shining. The crops didn't stop growing. Everything was fine. Nothing changed except that now someone else knew. Someone else was privy to the secret I had kept to myself for the past two years, the secret I even kept from myself all my life before that. I could be gay and be me and nothing was to change.</p>

			<p>I told my parents then. After about 5 minutes of shock they reassured me that nothing would change, that I was still the same son and they were still my same parents. But things had changed. I was the son they would never watch marry. I was the son who would never bring them grandchildren. I was the son with an uncertain future outside of THEIR frame of reference. There were different legal limits to me and my straight brothers (years later one of my younger brothers was also to come out, but at the time...)</p>

			<p>In 2010 the Irish government introduced civil partnerships, for the first time legislating for the legal rights of same-sex couples. For a country in which homosexuality had been illegal until 1993, this was an unprecedented leap forward. We, the gay Irish community, were overjoyed, overwhelmed, ecstatic. And while this was an amazing step forward by our legislators, it still fell short of full, equal marital rights in many ways.</p>

			<p>Thus bringing us to the recent referendum. Under Irish law, any change to the constitution must be made by popular vote by people through a referendum. Our government wished to change the existing constitutional wording to read:</p>

			<p class="quote"><b><em>"Marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex."</em></b></p>

			<p>This referendum was simply about extending legal marital rights to same-sex couples. It was about equality. The government was asking the people of Ireland whether a minority with fewer rights should be given equal rights or not.</p>

			<p>One very important difference being that a civil partner does not automatically have visitation rights in a hospital. Another (ironic and symbolic of the very need for marriage equality) is that, in Ireland, a marriage certificate may be used as proof of identity at a polling station, whereas a civil partnership certificate may not. These are but two of the more than 160 differences between marriage and civil partnerships. Marriage, unsurprisingly, comes out on top in terms of the range and scope of rights conferred.</p>

			<p>The polls were to open at 7am on the 22nd of May, and supporters of both sides canvassed and advertised their opinion. The YES campaign in support of the proposed amendment, the NO campaign against. This is when things started to get ugly. While supporters and advocates of the YES campaign used logical arguments and scientific studies to promote their cause, the NO campaign resorted to the tried-and-tested fear mongering and bible-bashing. They turned the emphasis of the debate away from equality, away from love, and instead ran a misleading propaganda campaign along the lines of "Won't someone think of the children!"</p>

			<p>Their argument against marriage equality pivoted on the idea of marriage as a sacred union between man and woman, and that a child was better off with a mammy and a daddy, rather than two mothers or two fathers (an argument invalidated by the mountains of scientific psychology and sociological research that unequivocally has proven there is no difference in mental or physical well-being between children raised by same-sex parents and those raised by opposite-sex parents). The NO campaign argued marriage is an institution of procreation, the purpose of which is to bring children into this world, and that marriage equality would lead to adoption of children by gay couples (legislation for which had already been passed by our government and would be unaffected by the results of this referendum) and a rise in surrogacy (which they colourfully described as "womb for rent"...)</p>

			<p>I would argue that this very campaign swung the vote in the YES favour, for this rhetoric insulted and denegrated every straight couple who ever had difficulty conceiving (not to mention their families and friends who supported them through their harrowing ordeal &mdash; I know first hand how difficult it is; my uncle and his wife went through years of heartbreak trying to conceive, and are now the proud parents of my adopted cousin). Many straight couples took to the airwaves and recounted their difficulties with conceiving, many asking  that as they knew they couldn't conceive before they got married, should they not have been allowed to do so?Then things got ugly. Things got personal. The bible was brought to play.</p>

			<p>This article is just the broadest overview of what was a very long and very protracted debate, and it would take years of research to write a comprehensive blow-by-blow account of the journey Ireland took to marriage equality (the result of which would be substantially longer than my humble attempt). Suffice to say that the NO campaign used every homophobia-absolving verse was touted in defence of discrimination. "Why redefine marriage?" they asked, as if marriage always has and always will be. A status quo, gifted by God at the beginning, inviolable. Absolute rubbish, in my opinion. Whatever one's religious bent, one cannot argue that marriage has not changed, evolved, moved with the times. Divorce redefined marriage. Inter-faith marriage redefined marriage. Inter-race marriage too. In all cases, "traditional" marriage was redefined.</p>

			<p>And no one was hurt. The world didn't stop turning. All that happened in those cases was that two people of increasingly different walks of life were able to express their love for one another in a way that that love was recognised and protected by law. Almost word-for-word, the same objections to same-sex marriage was used to protest interracial marriage in the '60s, but common sense prevailed then in America as it did last month in Ireland - as it has done in over twenty countries over the last decade and a half. The LGBT community just want the same things as everyone else; to feel like loved, valued, equal members of society - not like some outside, quirky fringe that is merely tolerated.</p>

			<p>That is why I voted. That is why I stood up and was counted. And for the first time in my life I don't feel alone, I don't feel like an outsider. My fellow countrymen - straight, gay, in between - voted by a majority of almost two to one in favour of marriage equality, and it is no exaggeration to say I was in tears watching the results unfold. I felt included. I felt valued. I felt loved.</p>

			<p>As for why in the previous eight years I have never mustered the enthusiasm to vote, well, that's a discussion for another article...</p>
